Online CMMS written in php and using a mySQL database. This software has been developed to run on my company and after one year of continuous use, I decided to release it to the public under a GNU license.

It works pretty well at this point but there's some levels of configuration that still cannot happen on the front-end mostly because I had no time to implement them (hence also the open source release to see if anyone can assist me with this). These levels of configuration need to be done directly on the database using, among others, phpMyAdmin.

It includes a working work order flow system from manual work requests to final reports. It also implements a basic but functional maintenance plan system where orders are issued automatically based on time cycles.
